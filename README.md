# Perform a SQL query 

<h2>Introduction</h2> 

In this lab, you’ll learn how to retrieve information from a database using SQL. You’ll be using the MariaDB shell to run your SQL queries.

<h2>What you’ll do</h2>

You have multiple tasks in this lab:

- Return information on employee devices
- Examine login attempts
- Sort the data returned from a query

<h2>Scenario</h2>

In this scenario, you have to determine which employee devices must be updated. You also need to investigate user login activity to explore if any unusual activity has occurred.

The information you need is located in the machines and login_attempts tables in the organization database.

Here’s how you’ll do this task: First, you’ll obtain information on the employee devices that must be updated. Next, you’ll examine the login attempts for unusual activity. Finally, you’ll use the ORDER BY keyword to sort the data returned by your SQL queries.
